      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The <em>Final Models Selection Using WAXSiS</em> tab is the final step in SAXS-A-FOLD, allowing the computation of I(q) profiles for NNLS-selected models and optional adjacent frames from the original MMC run. This ensures a comprehensive analysis and selection of the best models for SAXS data interpretation.

      <h2>Fields in the Final Models Tab</h2>
      <p>Besides the standard <strong>Project Name</strong>, <strong>Description</strong>, and <strong>Downloads</strong> fields, this tab includes the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Additional Adjacent Frames Count:</strong> Specifies the number of structures flanking the NNLS-selected models to include in the computation. Default value: 0.
          <ul>
            <li>This feature captures potentially overlooked models that may better contribute to the NNLS fitting procedure.</li>
            <li>Using this option significantly increases the computation time, with progress monitored via a progress bar and associated messages.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps to Finalize Model Selection</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Set Additional Adjacent Frames:</strong> Adjust the <strong>Additional Adjacent Frames Count</strong> field if needed. Use caution, as increasing this count will prolong computation time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Start Computations:</strong> Press <em>Submit</em> to compute I(q) profiles for NNLS-selected models and any additional frames. Progress is tracked in real time, and the projected computation time is updated as more runs are completed.
        </li>

      <h2>Outputs and Visualization</h2>
      <p>
        Once the I(q) calculations are completed, a final NNLS fit is automatically performed. The results include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A new plot to the right of the original data plot, showing:
          <ul>
            <li>WAXSiS-calculated I(q) profiles for each NNLS-selected structure, scaled to the experimental I(q) curve.</li>
            <li>The reconstructed I(q) curve based on the percent contribution of each computed I(q) curve, including propagated SD.</li>
          </ul>
          Users can toggle individual curves on/off by clicking their corresponding entry in the legend.
        </li>
        <li>
          Below the plot, a list of NNLS-selected models is displayed, along with their percent contribution to the fit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Options to download:
          <ul>
            <li>The entire dataset of I(q) profiles shown in the plot.</li>
            <li>The selected models in a single NMR-style file.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The selected models are visualized in an interactive JSmol viewer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Models are spatially aligned on the previously chosen sequence.</li>
        <li>Each model is colored differently and displayed in ribbons mode by default.</li>
        <li>Users can access additional viewing options, such as showing only a particular model, by right-clicking on the viewer.</li>
      </ul>
