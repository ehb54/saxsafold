      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The <em>Run MMC</em> tab is used to perform Monomer Monte Carlo (MMC) simulations to explore possible conformational flexibility in the structural model. This simulation generates a series of structural variations, helping to refine the fit between experimental and computational data for both I(q) and P(r).

      <h2>Fields in the Run MMC Tab</h2>
      <p>
        Below the standard <strong>Project Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields, the MMC tab contains the following fields:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Downloads:</strong> Allows downloading the starting structure in "PDB" or "mmCIF" formats, and the experimental "Iq" and "Pr" files. Right-click on these labels to access the download options.</li>
        <li><strong>Run Name:</strong> Automatically generated by appending the project name to "run" (not editable).</li>
        <li><strong>Reference PDB:</strong> Reports the starting structure filename for the MMC run (not editable).</li>
        <li><strong>Output File Name (DCD):</strong> Generated by appending ".dcd" to the run name. Contains all the structures sequentially generated in the MMC run (not editable).</li>
        <li><strong>Number of Trial Attempts:</strong> Total number of sequential steps in the MMC run (default: 50,000). User modifiable. For this example, 20,000 steps were used.</li>
        <li><strong>Return to Previous Structure:</strong> Set to "20". After this number of failed steps, the program resets to the current coordinates (not user modifiable).</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature (K):</strong> Fixed at 300 K (not user modifiable).</li>
        <li><strong>Molecule Type:</strong> Set to "protein" (not user modifiable).</li>
        <li><strong>Number of Flexible Regions to Vary:</strong> Defined in the previous tab, not user modifiable here.</li>
        <li><strong>Residue Range for Each Flexible Region:</strong> Defined in the previous tab, not user modifiable here.</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum Angle(s):</strong> Set to 30Â°, which is the maximum torsion angle each flexible region can sample in a single move (not user modifiable).</li>
        <li><strong>Structure Alignment Range:</strong> Residue range used to spatially align all MMC-generated models. Should correspond to a non-flexible region. User modifiable.</li>
        <li><strong>Overlap Basis:</strong> Defines the basis for overlap checks to reject structures with clashes. Default is "heavy atoms." Other options include:
          <ul>
            <li>"all" atoms (if H atoms are defined).</li>
            <li>"backbone" atoms.</li>
            <li>Manually entered atom name.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps to Run MMC</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Configure the Input:</strong> Review the fields above and modify user-modifiable parameters as needed, such as <strong>Number of Trial Attempts</strong> and <strong>Structure Alignment Range</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Run the MMC Simulation:</strong> Press <em>Submit</em> to launch the MMC run. A progress bar and percentage updates will display the simulation status.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Outputs and Visualization</h2>
      <p>
        Once the MMC run is completed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A graph displaying the radius of gyration (Rg) for all generated and accepted structures as a function of structure number will be shown.</li>
        <li>A printed summary will include the number of accepted structures over the total generated.</li>
        <li>Other key metrics and details from the run will be reported for further analysis.</li>
      </ul>
